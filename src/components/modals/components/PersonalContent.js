      <p>
        Welcome to my world where science fiction is more than just a genre â€“
        it's a lifelong fascination. Star Trek has been my loyal companion,
        sparking my imagination since childhood. When I'm not immersed in design
        or coding, you might find me cycling through scenic routes or lifting
        weights to channel my energy.<br></br>
        <br></br>My home doubles as a theater space, serving up some sci fi on
        demand. As a devoted fan of the NFL, my heart belongs to the Kansas City
        Chiefs, reigning SuperBowl champions and the reason for some Monday
        morning grogginess.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>Embracing my inner technophile, I constantly keep tabs on
        cutting-edge gadgets and advancements in aerospace, infrastructure and
        the latest in home automation. Innovation drives me, and I'm always
        excited to see how technology reshapes our world. Whether I'm crafting
        captivating designs or exploring new galaxies in science fiction, my
        journey is marked by curiosity, creativity, and an desire to keep
        learning.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>Lastly my wife and I cohabit with two adorable feline friends,
        Kira (13) and Milo (7), who light up our days with their antics.
