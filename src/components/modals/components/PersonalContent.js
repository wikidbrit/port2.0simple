        Welcome to my world where science fiction is more than just a genre â€“
        it's a lifelong fascination. Star Trek has been my loyal companion,
        sparking my imagination since childhood. When I'm not immersed in design
        or coding, you might find me cycling through scenic routes or lifting
        weights to channel my energy.

        grogginess.
